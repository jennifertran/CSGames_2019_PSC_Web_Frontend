# Competition Description:

The multiverses are converging, and we’re hiring!

In an effort to hire the best and the brightest talent not only in this universe-ities but in others, the Public Service Commission is looking at implementing a new recruitment solution that will allow talented job-seekers to apply to government jobs no matter where they are. The challenge is substantial: we need to hire people across multiple Canadas, keep track of the special skills needed to provide government services in parallel universes, and make sure anyone can apply, no matter the quality of their internet connection in their own reality. Time is running out – we needed this yesterday, and we haven’t perfected time-travel yet.
